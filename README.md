My Input:
### Covered in the Tutorial
Array Creation & Types: Creating arrays of different shapes, sizes, and data types.
Accessing/Modifying Data: Indexing, slicing, and changing elements in arrays (including 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays).
Array Properties: Attributes like shape, size, ndim, dtype, itemsize.
Initialization: Zeros, ones, full, random values, identity matrices, and repeating arrays.
Copying Arrays: Difference between assignment and copying (important for avoiding bugs).
Mathematics: Element-wise operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers), trigonometric functions, etc.
Linear Algebra: Matrix multiplication, determinant, and a note about further operations (inverse, eigenvalues, etc.).
Statistics: min, max, sum, mean, etc. (partially shown, but likely included).
Practical Examples: Combining and modifying arrays, constructing special structures (like "frame" matrices).

### What’s Not Covered (But Useful Later)
Broadcasting: Some advanced NumPy operations leverage broadcasting—automatic expansion of arrays’ shapes.
Advanced Indexing: Boolean indexing, fancy indexing for more complex data selection.
Performance Tuning: Vectorization and avoiding loops for speed.
File I/O: Reading/writing arrays from/to files (e.g., np.loadtxt, np.genfromtxt, np.save).
Integration with Pandas: Most ML workflows also use pandas for tabular data.
